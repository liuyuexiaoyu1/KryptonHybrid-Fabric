/**
 * Thread-local cache that avoids redundant packet serialization when the same
 * {@link net.minecraft.network.protocol.Packet} instance is encoded by
 * {@link net.minecraft.network.PacketEncoder} on the same Netty I/O thread for
 * multiple connections.
 *
 * <h3>How it works</h3>
 * <p>Minecraft's broadcast pattern sends the <strong>same Packet object reference</strong>
 * to N players via {@code ChunkHolder.broadcast(List, Packet)} and
 * {@code TrackedEntity.broadcast(Packet)}.  Each connection has its own
 * {@link net.minecraft.network.PacketEncoder}, but connections sharing the same
 * Netty I/O event-loop thread will encode the same Packet instance sequentially.
 * By caching the serialized bytes keyed on object identity, subsequent encodes
 * of the same Packet on the same thread become a simple byte copy — skipping all
 * VarInt/NBT/collection serialization.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
 * <p>All state is {@link ThreadLocal}.  With {@code NioEventLoopGroup(0)}, Netty
 * creates {@code availableProcessors × 2} I/O threads.  Each thread handles a
 * subset of connections.  The cache is effective within each thread's connection
 * set — typically {@code totalPlayers / (2 × cores)} connections per thread.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Lifecycle</h3>
 * <p>The cache is bounded by {@link #MAX_ENTRIES}.  When the limit is reached,
 * the entire map is cleared.  Because Packet objects are short-lived (created each
 * tick, unreferenced after the pipeline flush), the IdentityHashMap entries
 * naturally become stale and don't prevent GC once cleared.</p>
 *
