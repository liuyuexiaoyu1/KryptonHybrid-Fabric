/**
 * Thread-local cache of <strong>post-Zstd compressed</strong> wire bytes keyed
 * by {@link Packet} identity.  Companion to {@link BroadcastSerializationCache}
 * which caches raw serialized bytes (pre-compression).
 *
 * <h3>Why a separate cache?</h3>
 * <p>{@link BroadcastSerializationCache} eliminates redundant
 * <em>serialization</em> work, but Zstd compression is still re-run for every
 * recipient sharing a Netty I/O thread because the compressor sees only the
 * raw bytes and cannot know they came from the same Packet.  This cache closes
 * that gap by storing the final compressed payload (length-prefix already
 * written) so that the compressor can short-circuit to {@code out.writeBytes}
 * for repeat encounters.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Scope restriction</h3>
 * <p>Only large broadcast packets benefit (chunk + light updates).  Caching
 * every packet would waste memory and inflate the LRU.  See
 * {@link #isCacheable(Packet)}.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Lifecycle</h3>
 * <p>Same as the parent cache — {@link ThreadLocal}, capped at
 * {@link #MAX_ENTRIES} per thread, full-clear on overflow.  Smaller cap (64)
 * because compressed chunk packets are large (~8 KB each) and we don't want
 * unbounded heap retention.</p>
