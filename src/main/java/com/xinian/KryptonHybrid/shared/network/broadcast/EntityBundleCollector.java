/**
 * Thread-local collector that batches per-player packets during the entity tracking
 * tick and flushes them as {@link ClientboundBundlePacket}s at the end of the tick.
 *
 * <h3>Motivation</h3>
 * <p>During {@code ChunkMap.tick()}, each tracked
 * entity calls {@link net.minecraft.server.level.ServerEntity#sendChanges() sendChanges()},
 * which may emit multiple packets (position, rotation, metadata, velocity, head rotation)
 * to every nearby player via
 * {@code ChunkMap.TrackedEntity.broadcast(Packet)}.  Without bundling, each packet is
 * individually:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Serialized to bytes (VarInt packet ID + payload)</li>
 *   <li>Framed with a VarInt length prefix (1–3 bytes overhead per packet)</li>
 *   <li>Compressed independently (ZSTD/LZ4/zlib)</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>Compressing many small payloads independently yields worse ratios than compressing
 * a single concatenated payload of the same total size.  Additionally, each frame carries
 * fixed per-packet overhead (VarInt length prefix, compression header, etc.).</p>
 *
 * <h3>Solution — Tick-scoped per-player packet batching</h3>
 * <p>The collector works in three phases:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>{@link #beginBatch()}:</strong> called at the start of
 *       {@code ChunkMap.tick()} — creates a thread-local
 *       {@code IdentityHashMap&lt;ServerPlayerConnection, List&lt;Packet&gt;&gt;}.</li>
 *   <li><strong>{@link #collect(ServerPlayerConnection, Packet)}:</strong> called by
 *       the {@code TrackedEntityBundleMixin} redirect in
 *       {@code TrackedEntity.broadcast()} — instead of sending each packet immediately,
 *       appends it to the player's collection list.  If the packet is itself a
 *       {@link ClientboundBundlePacket}, its sub-packets are unwrapped and appended
 *       individually to prevent illegal bundle nesting.</li>
 *   <li><strong>{@link #endBatchAndFlush()}:</strong> called at the end of
 *       {@code ChunkMap.tick()} — for each player that has collected packets:
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>Single packet → sent directly (no bundle overhead).</li>
 *         <li>Two or more packets → wrapped in a {@link ClientboundBundlePacket}
 *             and sent as a single protocol message.</li>
 *       </ul>
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Bundle protocol details</h3>
 * <p>{@link ClientboundBundlePacket} is a vanilla Minecraft 1.19.4+ protocol feature.
 * On the wire it is serialized as:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   [BundleDelimiter packet]   — signals "start of bundle"
 *   [Packet₁]
 *   [Packet₂]
 *   ...
 *   [BundleDelimiter packet]   — signals "end of bundle"
 * </pre>
 * <p>The client's {@link net.minecraft.network.PacketBundlePacker PacketBundlePacker}
 * collects all packets between delimiters and delivers them atomically to the game
 * thread.  From the client renderer's perspective, all bundled state changes appear
 * in the same tick — eliminating visual "tearing" (e.g. entity teleporting before
 * its rotation updates).</p>
 *
 * <h3>Performance benefits</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Reduced framing overhead:</strong> N packets × (1–3 byte length prefix)
 *       is reduced to 2 × (delimiter frame) + 1 × (bundle frame).  For 20 packets
 *       this saves ~40–60 bytes.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Better compression ratio:</strong> one large compressed payload
 *       compresses 10–30% better than N small payloads of the same total size,
 *       because ZSTD/LZ4 can exploit cross-packet redundancy (e.g. similar entity IDs,
 *       repeated VarInt patterns).</li>
 *   <li><strong>Client-side atomicity:</strong> bundled updates are applied in a single
 *       client tick, preventing intermediate visual states.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Exception safety</h3>
 * <p>If an exception occurs during {@code ChunkMap.tick()} and the RETURN inject
 * does not fire, the thread-local batch remains populated.  The next tick's HEAD
 * inject calls {@link #endBatchAndFlush()} as a recovery step before
 * {@link #beginBatch()}, ensuring stale packets are delivered and the collector is
 * reset to a clean state.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
 * <p>All state is stored in a {@link ThreadLocal}.  {@code ChunkMap.tick()} runs on
 * the server main thread; {@code TrackedEntity.broadcast()} is called synchronously
 * from the same thread.  No cross-thread access occurs.</p>
