/**
 * Intercepts {@link ChunkHolder#broadcastChanges}'s internal fan-out to collect
 * per-player block-change packets into the {@link BroadcastBundleCollector} when
 * a collection window is active.
 *
 * <h3>Target method</h3>
 * <p>{@code ChunkHolder.broadcast(List<ServerPlayer>, Packet<?>)} is the private
 * helper that iterates over a player list and calls
 * {@code player.connection.send(packet)} for each.  It is used by
 * {@code broadcastChanges()} to distribute block updates, light updates, and
 * block-entity updates to nearby players.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Redirect behavior</h3>
 * <p>When the {@link BroadcastBundleCollector} has an active collection window
 * (opened by {@link ServerChunkCacheBroadcastMixin}), this mixin intercepts the
 * {@code broadcast()} call and routes each player's packet to the collector.
 * When no window is active, the original method runs unchanged.</p>
