/**
 * Adds flush consolidation and packet bundle coalescing to {@code ChunkMap.tick()}
 * (the entity tracking tick).
 *
 * <h3>Flush consolidation</h3>
 * <p>During a tracking tick, each entity sends movement/metadata packets to every
 * nearby player.  Without consolidation this results in one {@code flush()} syscall
 * per packet per player.  By disabling auto-flush at the start of the tick and
 * re-enabling it (which triggers a single flush) at the end, all packets for a given
 * player are coalesced into one kernel write, dramatically reducing system-call
 * overhead on busy servers.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Bundle coalescing</h3>
 * <p>In addition to Netty-level flush consolidation, this mixin opens a protocol-level
 * collection window via {@link EntityBundleCollector}.  During the window, the
 * {@link TrackedEntityBundleMixin} redirect collects all per-player entity update
 * packets instead of sending them individually.  At the end of the tick, collected
 * packets are wrapped in {@link net.minecraft.network.protocol.game.ClientboundBundlePacket
 * ClientboundBundlePacket}s and sent as single protocol messages.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Interaction between the two systems</h3>
 * <p>The two optimizations operate at different layers and are complementary:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>Bundle coalescing (protocol layer):</strong> N individual packets
 *       become 1 BundlePacket — reducing per-packet framing overhead and improving
 *       compression ratio (one large payload compresses better than N small ones).</li>
 *   <li><strong>Flush consolidation (Netty layer):</strong> the single BundlePacket
 *       (plus any unbatched packets) is buffered at the channel level and flushed in
 *       one syscall at the end of the tick.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Execution order within {@code tick()}</h3>
 * <pre>
 *   HEAD:   [1] Recovery: flush stale bundle batch (exception safety)
 *           [2] Recovery: re-enable auto-flush (exception safety)
 *           [3] Disable auto-flush for all players
 *           [4] Open bundle collection window
 *
 *   BODY:   Entity tracking updates → packets collected by TrackedEntityBundleMixin
 *
 *   RETURN: [5] Close bundle window → send BundlePackets (buffered, not flushed)
 *           [6] Re-enable auto-flush → single kernel flush per player
 * </pre>
